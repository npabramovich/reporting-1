 * (`lp_tracking` is a feature-visibility domain, not the retired entity-wide accounting mode.)
 * The accounts are resolved per partner and date from whatever evidence supports them — posted
 * postings, or the pasted / manually-entered dated positions edited on this same page, or both
 * with the overlap excluded. Either way it is the same capital-account statement; a vehicle with
 * only reported observations simply has fewer lines behind each figure.
