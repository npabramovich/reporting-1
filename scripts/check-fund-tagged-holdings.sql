-- WHY: `loadFofActive` (lib/portfolio/fof.ts) switches the entire fund-of-funds feature set on
-- when ANY company has holding_type = 'fund' — it is derived from the data, not a setting. So a
-- handful of dormant rows turn on "Underlying funds" and "Quarterly close (funds)" for the whole
-- firm, and (before it was deleted) listed themselves as zero-figure rows on every entity's
-- fund-of-funds report.
--
-- This lists every fund-tagged holding with what is actually attached to it, so you can tell a
-- real position from a name somebody typed once. The last column mirrors what the DELETE route
-- refuses on, so it says whether a holding can simply be removed.

--
