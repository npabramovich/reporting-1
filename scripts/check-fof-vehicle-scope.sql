-- Read-only. Paste the whole thing into the Supabase SQL editor and run it.
--
-- ONE statement on purpose: the editor returns only the last result set, so a script of several
-- queries silently hands back just the final table.
--
-- WHY: the fund-of-funds figures are scoped by `fund_capital_events.vehicle_id` /
-- `fund_nav_statements.vehicle_id`, which is the only place a fund holding's entity is recorded.
-- Rows with no entity belong to no entity's schedule of investments, and `confirmFundCapitalEvent`
-- refuses to post them. Row 1 below is the number that decides whether a repair is needed.
--
-- Works BEFORE or AFTER 20261006220000, which is the migration that adds
-- `fund_holding_terms.vehicle_id`. Section 6 reads that column through to_jsonb so the query
-- parses either way: if the column does not exist yet the key is simply absent and every
-- commitment reports (NO ENTITY).
