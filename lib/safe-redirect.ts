/**
 * Validate a `?next=` destination before redirecting a user to it.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE: the obvious check —
 *
 *     next.startsWith('/') && !next.startsWith('//')
 *
 * is WRONG, and wrong in a way that looks right. For special schemes (http/https)
 * the WHATWG URL spec treats a backslash exactly like a forward slash, so
 *
 *     new URL('/\\evil.com', 'https://app.example.com')  ->  https://evil.com/
 *
 * `/\evil.com` passes both of those conditions and still leaves the origin. Next's
 * router resolves the href against location and hard-navigates when the origin
 * differs, so the user is handed to the attacker's site.
 *
 * That matters most on exactly the pages that use this: a redirect fired
 * IMMEDIATELY AFTER a successful sign-in or MFA prompt is a phishing primitive —
 * the victim sees the real domain and a real TLS cert, authenticates, and is then
 * bounced somewhere hostile while they still believe they're inside the app.
 *
 * So: allowlist, don't blocklist. A destination must be a plain same-origin path.
